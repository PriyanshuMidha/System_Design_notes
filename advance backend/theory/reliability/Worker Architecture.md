# Worker Architecture

## Complete notes

Worker architecture separates API servers from background processors.

## Easy explanation

Worker architecture separates API servers from background processors.

In simple words: if you can explain `Worker Architecture` with one real request, one failure case, and one metric, you understand the topic much better than just memorizing the definition.

## Simple example

Think of keeping the product working even when dependencies fail or traffic spikes. This topic explains how to limit blast radius and recover safely.

For `Worker Architecture`, ask yourself:

1. What is the normal happy path?
2. What can fail?
3. What is the tradeoff?
4. What would I monitor in production?

## Real-life examples

### Easy real-life example

If an email service is down, the app should still save the user signup and send the email later.

### Difficult production example

A checkout system must survive provider timeouts, retries, queue backlog, worker crashes, poison messages, partial failure, and dependency overload while protecting user-facing SLOs.

### How to relate this topic

When reading `Worker Architecture`, connect it to:

- one user action
- one backend component
- one failure case
- one tradeoff
- one metric

## Important points

- Core idea: `Worker Architecture` must be understood through its production use case, not just its definition.
- When to use it: Focus on timeout, retry, backoff, jitter, circuit breaker, idempotency, DLQ, graceful degradation, backpressure, and recovery testing.
- At scale: explain the bottleneck, failure path, operational owner, and rollback/fallback.
- What to monitor: SLO burn, error rate, p95/p99 latency, timeout count, retry count, queue age, DLQ size, and circuit breaker state.
- Interview rule: always give one concrete example, one tradeoff, one failure mode, and one metric.

## Common mistakes

- Retrying forever or retrying non-idempotent operations.
- No timeout on network calls.
- No fallback or degraded mode for optional dependencies.
- Letting queue backlog grow without DLQ or alerting.
- Testing only the happy path and not failure recovery.

## SDE-3 depth notes

### Real production use

Use this topic when you need to process queues for emails, notifications, payments, indexing, and media processing.

### What to explain in interviews

- <span class="sd-key">Where it sits in the architecture</span>: client, API layer, service layer, data layer, infrastructure, or operations.
- <span class="sd-good">Why it is chosen</span>: what problem it solves better than the simpler alternative.
- <span class="sd-tradeoff">Tradeoff</span>: cost, complexity, latency, consistency, operability, or security.
- <span class="sd-risk">Failure mode</span>: queue backlog, uneven worker concurrency, retry storms, and lost acknowledgements.

### Example explanation

In a production ecommerce system, `Worker Architecture` is not just a definition. You should connect it to a concrete request path, data path, or deployment path. Explain what happens during normal traffic, what breaks during high load or partial failure, and how the team detects and recovers from it.

### Revision prompts

1. What problem does this solve?
2. What is the simplest version?
3. What changes at scale?
4. What can go wrong?
5. What metric or alert proves it is healthy?


## Deep understanding checklist

To fully understand `Worker Architecture`, be able to answer:

1. Where does it sit in the architecture?
2. What production problem does it solve?
3. What is the simplest implementation?
4. What breaks when traffic or data grows?
5. What is the main failure mode?
6. What tradeoff does it introduce?
7. Which metric proves it is healthy?

Strong answer focus: Focus on timeout, retry, backoff, jitter, circuit breaker, idempotency, DLQ, graceful degradation, backpressure, and recovery testing.

## Senior interview bank

These are topic-specific questions and strong answers for `Worker Architecture`.

### 1. What is the failure this pattern prevents?

Name the exact failure: timeout, retry storm, overload, duplicate side effect, poison message, queue backlog, or dependency outage. Then explain how the pattern limits blast radius.

### 2. What is the fallback or degraded mode?

Critical flows should continue while optional features degrade. For example, checkout continues without recommendations, email is queued for later, and analytics can be dropped temporarily.

### 3. How do you avoid making failure worse?

Use timeouts, retry budgets, exponential backoff with jitter, circuit breakers, idempotency, backpressure, and DLQs. Never retry forever and never let optional work consume critical resources.

### 4. What should alert?

Alert on user-visible symptoms: high error rate, high latency, low success rate, queue age, DLQ growth, SLO burn, and dependency outage. Avoid paging on noisy internal signals unless they predict user impact.

### 5. How do you prove the recovery path works?

Test it with failure injection, staging drills, load tests, replay from DLQ, rollback exercises, and runbooks. A recovery path that was never tested is a guess.

## Topic-specific drill

### How would I answer `Worker Architecture` if the interviewer asks directly?

For `Worker Architecture`, I would explain the failure it protects against, how it limits blast radius, what fallback exists, and which SLO or queue/dependency metric should alert.

### What is the trap question for `Worker Architecture`?

The trap is giving only a definition. A senior answer must include a concrete production example, a failure mode, a tradeoff, and a metric.

### What should I draw?

Draw the smallest flow that shows where `Worker Architecture` sits, then add the failure path next to the happy path.

## Reviewer checklist

- Can I explain this without reading the note?
- Can I draw the happy path and failure path?
- Can I name one concrete metric?
- Can I explain the tradeoff against a simpler option?
- Can I give a production example in under two minutes?
